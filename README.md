Empower Your Shower

Website designed and created for AT&T Women in Technology hackathon. 

Water scarcity affects millions of people on every continent everyday, and results in millions of deaths per year. One in nine people do not have access to clean water although the resources exist. Empower Your Shower is a webapp that uses a Harman API to let a user play music while they shower. Our algorithm times how long you were in the shower and then converts it to gallons, letting you know how much water you consumed and what the effects are. Our website also provides information and statistics about water scarcity worldwide and offers solutions to cut down on household water wastage.
